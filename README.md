# Bike_Sales_Analysis
A complete Bike Sales data analysis project built using Microsoft Excel.
This project reads raw customer and sales data, cleans it, performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), and builds an interactive dashboard to visualize insights.
The project follows a real Excel tutorial covering data cleaning, pivot tables, visuals, and dashboard creation.

# Dataset Description
The dataset contains customer and sales information related to bike purchases, with the following fields:
-ID.
-Marital Status.
-Gender.
-Income.
-Children.
-Education.
-Occupation.
-Home Owner.
-Cars.
-Commute Distance.
-Region.
-Age.
-Purchased Bike (Yes / No).

# Project Goals
-Clean & preprocess the data.
-Handle duplicate rows and inconsistent formatting.
-Transform data into usable formats (e.g., gender labels, age groups).
-Perform exploratory analysis to understand patterns.
-Create PivotTables and charts.
-Build an Interactive Excel Dashboard.

# Tools & Techniques Used
-Microsoft Excel.
-Data Cleaning.
-Formulas & Functions (e.g., IF, COUNTIFS, SUMIFS).
-Pivot Tables.
-Pivot Charts & Visualization.
-Dashboard Design with Slicers.

# Key Components
1. Data Cleaning:
-Remove duplicates.
-Standardize values (e.g., gender, marital status).
-Create new calculated columns (like age groups for better analysis).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
-Analyze customer segments by gender, income, age, region.
-Compare buyers vs non‑buyers.
-Understand patterns using histograms and summary tables.

3. Pivot Table Analysis:
--PivotTables help answer questions like:
-Who buys more bikes? (by gender, income, age)
-How does commute distance affect purchasing behavior?
-Bike purchases by region and other factors.

4. Interactive Dashboard:
--The dashboard includes:
-KPI summaries (Totals and counts).
-PivotCharts showing trends and comparisons.
-Slicers for interactive filtering.
-Users can filter by Region, Marital Status, Cars, etc.
